✅ Set up project base with Vite + React + TypeScript

✅ Installed and configured Tailwind CSS v4 using the new CSS-first approach (@import "tailwindcss")

✅ Configured ESLint with modern flat config, TypeScript support, React rules, and accessibility (jsx-a11y)

✅ Added Prettier with clean formatting rules

✅ Created a minimal README

🔧 Cleaned up boilerplate, removed unnecessary files, and prepared project structure

🧠 Reviewed Tailwind v4 changes and updated setup to align with current best practices (no init, no config needed unless extending)

🗓️ Update – May 28, 2025
✅ Added core design tokens using `@theme` (colors, typography, spacing, etc.)

✅ Created semantic tokens for use case heading (font size, weight, stroke, etc.)

✅ Built `utilities.css` with custom utility classes:
  • `.heading-usecase` for section titles
  • `.btn`, `.btn-primary`, `.btn-outline` for buttons
  • `.tag` for skill/category pills
  • `.card`, `.card-hover` for project blocks

✅ Removed `[var(--...)]` usage from markup by using clean, readable class names

✅ Fully aligned with Tailwind v4’s CSS-first setup (no config, just tokens + utilities)

🔜 Next: build base layout (`Header`, `Footer`, `Main`) and hook up Framer Motion
