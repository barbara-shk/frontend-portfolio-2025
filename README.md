# Barbara Sahok – UX Engineer Portfolio

Hi! I'm Barbara, a front-end developer with a UX design background. This portfolio is where I combine my passion for thoughtful design and solid engineering. It's built from scratch with **React**, **Vite**, **Tailwind CSS v4**, and **TypeScript**, and it's a place to showcase the things I care about: expressive UI, clean code, accessibility, and performance.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

* **Framework:** React + Vite + TypeScript
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 (CSS-first config, clean and fast)
* **Animations:** Framer Motion (for fluid transitions and interaction)
* **Linting:** ESLint + Prettier + JSX a11y rules
* **Content:** Markdown/MDX blog coming soon
* **Design System:** Custom components built with Radix UI and Tailwind

## 🚀 Getting Started

If you're checking this out locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then head to `http://localhost:5173`.

## 🛠️ Tooling

* **Linting:** ESLint with TypeScript, React, and accessibility rules
* **Formatting:** Prettier
* **Accessibility:** `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` to enforce a11y during development
* **Strict mode:** TypeScript strict config is on

## 📂 Project Structure

```
src/
🔺️ components/    # Reusable UI elements (WIP)
🔺️ pages/         # Sections of the site (Home, Work, About, etc.)
🔺️ styles/        # Global styles and theme tokens
🔺️ assets/        # Custom blobs, SVGs, and images
🔺️ content/       # Blog posts (Markdown or MDX)
```

## ✨ Goals

This portfolio isn’t just a resume — it's a living project. I’m using it to:

* Build and scale a custom design system
* Play with CSS graphics, SVG blobs, and animation
* Write about my process and share what I learn
* Showcase real front-end architecture, not just pretty pixels

## 🧐 Philosophy

Design should be intentional. Code should be clear. Interaction should feel effortless.
I'm building this to reflect that—visually and structurally.
